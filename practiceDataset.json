In this role I coordinated a team of Data Analysts and Data Engineers and helped to create the communication rules and best practices between this team and the rest of the company. Some of the projects I pushed for in this company were data governance and data democratization. My team was in charge of consolidating all information available and spread in different systems into one place, document it and make it available to end users when they need it. I've also worked on data insights, exploration and hypothesis testing related to User Generated Content. Those were used by the company to prove the value of their offerings to existent and potential clients. Show less\"},{\"description\":\"Prepared weekly and monthly sales reports.
